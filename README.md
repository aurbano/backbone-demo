## Changes
This file describes the changes done in the source code in order to meet the requirements.

### Task 1
The event to intercept was the cancel event on the formview.
It's located in js/view/formview.js, I decided on a JS confirm() since I tried to maintain it as simple as possible.

### Task 2
Add Require.js file to the lib folder, decided on this vs cdn just in case you will test it offline.
